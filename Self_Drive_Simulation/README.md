# Self Driving Simulation using PilotNET


# Result of Simulation




# 1. Dataset Collection

Dataset was generated by driving around the car in Carla-Simulator while saving the imageds from camera sensor and saving the steer controls siultaneously. 
Around 100 images were generated. ( High RAM requirement and time Requirementlimited the amount of dataset generated )

An example CSV file is available [here](/file5.csv)

# 2. Understanding and building Network

Simulation was to be done using [PilotNET by NVIDIA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf)

Pretrained weights for transfer learning was procured from [GTA5 implementation of PilotNET](https://github.com/Will-J-Gale/GTA5-Self-Driving-Car)


Here are the [weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/110YcrCg0uxw_6t-Q5esMNLzssNx4Lx8z/view?usp=sharing) after additional training on my dataset

# 3. Preprocessing and training 

Preprocessing and training was done [here](/SelfDriveSimulation.ipynb)

Training was done on pilotNET model-




# 4. Building Pipeline

Carla-Simulator was setup on Python3.5 and tensorflow 2.1.0.

Client side python file was made for capturing images from camera, getting predictions from model and applying control to car. Throttle was put at a constant value of 0.5. Handbrake application was allowed manually to regulate throttle.

The client file for generating data is available [here](/simulation.py)

The client file for applying controls from model prediction is available [here](/self_driving_simulation.py)
